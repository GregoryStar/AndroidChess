# AndroidChess
Fully functional chess application for built for Android Lollipop.

App includes visual legal-move suggestion, game navigation, promotion dialog boxes,
and game-state alerts (checkmate, stalemate).

UI tends to scale well for most modern phones, but is not perfect. 
Short-term upgrades include:

  -Complete Scalability
  -Settings Menu (color, pieces, etc.)
  -Board Flipping with Moves
  
Eventually I'd also like to add a custom engine to play against, and possibly a
multiplayer component.

App is currently not published on the Play Store because its UI doesn't scale well
for all Android devices. Eventually, I'd like to fix that and publish this app, but
this probably won't happen until I have a lot of free time on my hands.
